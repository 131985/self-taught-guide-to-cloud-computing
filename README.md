## Note

This is a guide based on our experiences of going from help desk to Cloud and DevOps engineers. You journey is yours and you may need to learn different things at different stages.

We tried to keep it as general and using the most popular options (in terms of content, community, and jobs) as possible. As you grow, you'll need to get specialized in certain areas :)
