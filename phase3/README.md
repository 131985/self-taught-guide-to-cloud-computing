# Phase 3: Cloud Platform

This phase is the longest and for good reason, it's called cloud engineering for a reason.

AWS, Azure, GCP, the million dollar question. We would rule out GCP because there's so much more content, community, and jobs around the other two, essentials things when you're getting started. AWS or Azure? You can't go wrong with either. Regardless of which one you choose, the fundamentals are the same and our advice is the same.

Whichever cloud you pick, make sure you create an account and setup some budgets and alerts so you don't wake up to surprises on your bill. [Here](https://youtu.be/FZD0s7KE83Y) is how to do it in the Azure portal, and here [AWS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz0cphjHjg).

## A note on paid cloud learning platforms

There are platforms out there like [A Cloud Guru](https://acloudguru.com) and [CloudAcademy](https://cloudacademy.com) that you can pay for a monthly or yearly subscription and gain access to content and lab environments for your learning. These do help you avoid spending your own money in your own AWS and Azure accounts, which when you're getting started is a good thing. Ultimately, if you sign up for one, it's up to you. I had a subscription to A Cloud Guru and Linux Academy when I was getting started, my work paid for it though, maybe this is a perk your work can pay for too.

## Take a certification

I personally like cloud certifications, they give you a nice outline to follow in terms of learning. However I don't think you need to have every single certification out there. One or two, plus the Linux, networking, programming, knowledge is plenty and already quite impressive.

## What should my first cloud certification be?

You have two options here:

- Entry level certification: Like the [AWS Certified cloud practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/) or the [Azure Fundamentals AZ-900](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/exams/az-900).
- Skip the entry level and go for an associate level: AWS has [three](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/) associate level certifications and Azure has I believe [four now](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/browse/?resource_type=certification&products=azure&terms=associate).

You can skip the entry level one a take more time studying for the associate, or take them both. Up to you.

For the associate level AWS, I would go with any of them, I've heard the [SysOps](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-sysops-admin-associate/) one is the hardest. Personally I have the [AWS certified developer associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/) (it expired, but hey I still studied for it so I'm counting it!) it was a fun certification to study for. For Azure I would go for the [AZ-104](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/azure-administrator/) or [AZ-204](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/azure-developer/). The other associate level ones are a little more specificized. You can of course take them later on :)

## How to approach learning cloud computing

Regardless which learning material you choose, it'll have some sort of demo/hands-on aspect to it. Do it. Don't just watch/read. This isn't a Netflix show you're consuming, this is learning time. If the instructor is doing something on screen, watch it, and then try it on your own.

When you are first getting started with cloud, you'll be doing everything via the UI, This is fine for getting started, however once you're in a job, you'll be using a CLI to manage your environments. My advice here is, for every exercise you do via the UI, look up the CLI command and do it that way too.

Eventually you'll learn these commands and it'll become easier to remember which one to use, but this is also a great time to introduce yourself to the official documentation, [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/index.html) and [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/?product=featured)

If there is something you don't understand about a service or command, your go to should be the documentation. After that you can look up articles, tutorials, etc.
