# Phase 4: DevOps

Final phase. First off, read some stuff about what DevOps is. Each cloud platform has a suite of DevOps tools, I've linked a few articles here.

- [Microsoft - What is DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-devops/#overview)
- [AWS - What is DevOps](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/)
- [IBM - A DevOps complete guide](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/devops-a-complete-guide)

I also think it's worth reading [The Phoenix Project](https://itrevolution.com/the-phoenix-project/) it's a pretty fun read because it's a fictional story but it explains the importance of DevOps.

## DevOps practices

- Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)
- Version Control
- Infrastructure as Code
- Configuration management
- Continuous monitoring

You might be thinking that 4 weeks isn't a lot of time to cover all these, and you're right. With DevOps, it's so hard to establish a standard of learning, because every organization implements it differently. However, I think if you spent these 4 weeks learning Version control, CI/CD and Infrastructure as Code, you'll have  good foundation. You'll also be exposed to these practices in the resume projects I listed in the cloud projects table.

## Resources

| Practice      | Tool    |
| :------------- | :----------:
| Continuous integration and continuous delivery | [GitHub actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) |
| Version Control (you should've become familiar with Git in phase 2)| [Git and GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart)|
| Infrastructure as Code | [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) |

## Projects

Title    | Resources     |
 :----------: | -----------: |
| Deploy a VNet (or VPC) and 2 VMs in the cloud with Terraform | Make sure you can SSH into both VMs and from vm1 you can ping vm2 and vice-versa. |
| Remember that NAS project from Phase 1? | Deploy it with Terraform |

## What's next
