# Phase 1: Linux and networking essentials

The reason we pair them together is because lots of networking tasks are done via command line and Linux management is all about command line.

## Resources

I'll put these in the order I'd learn them in. If a row has a same number, it means I would watch/read along side each other.

| Order      | Title    | Notes     |
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: |
|  1| [Linux Basics for Hackers](https://nostarch.com/linuxbasicsforhackers)   | This book made learning Linux FUN! It's pretty easy to follow and take a chapter day by day.   |
| 1   | [The Linux Command Line](https://nostarch.com/tlcl2) | I used this more as a reference to reinforce topics from the first book. |
| 2   | [Introduction to Networking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNwEVYkx2Kk&list=PLDQaRcbiSnqF5U8ffMgZzS7fq1rHUI3Q8) | Great YouTube playlist of basic networking concepts. |
| Optional   | [Computer Networking Course - Network Engineering](https://youtu.be/qiQR5rTSshw) | This full college-level computer networking course will prepare you to configure, manage, and troubleshoot computer networks. |

Once you have gone through this content, I think you would have a solid basic level of Linux and networking knowledge, no you're not a professional, but you shouldn't feel lost or clueless. The two books I mentioned have several projects, DO THEM! Do not just read the theory! If there is a concept you don't understand, look it up, don't limit yourself to the resources I am sharing here.

## Projects

 Title    | Resources     |
 :----------: | -----------: |
 Install Linux on a computer   | Research a distro and install it (I really like [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/)) |
Setup a [LAMP server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)) | A pretty popular Linux admin task. |
 Deploy a NAS server | Checkout [FreeNAS](https://www.freenas.org/) |
